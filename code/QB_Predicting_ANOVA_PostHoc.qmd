## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
# Load data



# Inspect
str(QB)
summary(QB)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
# Convert categorical variables to factors
QB$RD_PICKED <- as.factor(QB$RD_PICKED)
QB$CONF <- as.factor(QB$CONF)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
anova_result <- aov(RATE ~ RD_PICKED, data = QB)
summary(anova_result)
```

```{r}
TukeyHSD(anova_result)

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(QB, aes(x = RD_PICKED, y = RATE, fill = CONF)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "QB Performance by Draft Round and Conference")

```

```{r}
# Normality
shapiro.test(residuals(anova_result))

# Homogeneity of variance
library(car)
leveneTest(RATE ~ RD_PICKED, data = QB)

```
